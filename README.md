<b>Elbi Donation System Project: ElGives</b>

<b> Program description: </b>

ElGives is a donation system application built using Flutter. This app serves as a medium for people who are willing to donate, organizations who are willing to manage donations,  and communities who are in need to receive these donations. The users may sign up either as a donor or as an organization. Additionally, an account was made exclusively for admins only. An admin can view information regarding donors, organizations, and the donations. Going in to the technical side of the app, it revolves around asynchronous programming where streams are able to provide data over the network. The data is stored using Google Firebase and is accessed through its API. Authentication and Storage are also utilized to handle user registrations and image uploads respectively. Lastly, some of the notable packages used by the app are flutter_sms which provide access to android's sms feature and qr_code/scanner which provide services to generating and scanning of QR codes.

<b> Installation Instructions: </b>

Afterwards, run your terminal in the directory of the project "group3-project". Run your emulator or connect your device. Then, enter "flutter pub get" to download all dependencies of the app. Finally, enter "flutter run" and enjoy the app.
